        "description": "CQRS (Command-Query Responsibility Segregation) is not anything new - it’s been a known for quite some time now. In the simplest form, CQRS only states that commands and queries are executed on different objects. Event Sourcing is a way to handle entity state as a sequence of events instead of the current state (and possible snapshots of the history). Often-heard complait about CQRS is that it introduces unnecessary complexity to a system. Surely, CQRS+ES systems do add quite a few classes/objects; messages; commands; queries; projections; events. But, all of those are themselves simple and often does only one thing, following Single Responsibility Principle. In this interactive talk, I hope to demystify most parts of the CQRS+Event Sourcing approach. In this live demo, we start with existing acceptance test describing a full use case (scenario) and already existing controller and repository layers. The coding happens ”one path at a time” showing how * to handle create a command in controller * to handle commands, logic touching multiple domain services / entities * to create an entity that is event sourced. * to create a projection that represents the state of an event at given time. The code exists in Github, with a separate branch for test-driving it oneself after the event. Code is written in Java, making the live programming easy to follow.",

        "description": "The Agile world seems to have recently discovered the importance of \"leadership\". This can be very good news and it can also very bad news. It's bad news if the so-called \"Agile Leadership\" is a way to rebrand traditional management models, along with their underlying mindset, so that they could survive in a rather different cultural ecosystem — namely, Agile. On the other hand, this interest can be very good news if Agile Leadership is seen as something almost entirely new. Something tightly connected to Agile and, therefore, deeply rooted in complexity and empiricism. Something that carries a deep understanding of human dynamics in highly cooperative, intellectually intense social environments. Something that — last but not least — is equipped with a good deal of self-awareness, system-awareness and self-transcendence. Modern and truly Agile organizations want and need to, among other things: explore and validate multiple options, not sticking to predefined plans; learn constantly, re-plan as needed; leverage the collective intelligence of their teams, for better exploration of options and smarter learning; have built-in resiliency when facing sudden change; getting results out of people's participation, not out of people's compliance. In this sense the whole concept of true Agile Leadership is quite important indeed, because it's fundamental to nurture and support those organizations that really embody an Agile culture, and that are so far away from the \"organization as a machine\" approach that's so typical of traditional leadership and management disciplines. Agile Leadership or, rather, the act of \"leading\" in Agile is so much different from those disciplines because it's inherently organic, meaning that it has influence and is influenced on a number of different levels in the individual and in the organization: on the personal level; on the collective level; on current behaviors; on future behaviors; on the social relationship level (trust); on the personal responsibility level (participation); on the formal responsibility level (accountability); on the motivational level and many more. This richness and multidimensionality of the act of leading in Agile is such that simplistic mental models (such as the leader being the \"guy at the top\") simply won't suffice and therefore a more mature understanding and practice of leading is called for, in the entire organization. In this talk we will discuss the case for Agile leadership, why we need it, what are the benefits to the organization and why it's different from other leadership approaches. We'll talk about the individual skills and \"mental stances\" that allow leaders to support an organizational Agile mindset. We'll talk about accountability, personal responsibility and the what it means to influence. Finally, we will challenge a few common assumptions on leadership and suggest alternatives. The intent is to have the attendees leave the room with a fresh perspective on Agile leadership and with practical advice on how to enable this kind on leadership in their organizations. The speaker has been working on Agile cultural shift for organizations for years, helping them to redesign their structures to be consistent with the Agile values, and has been working on Agile leadership well before it became a popular topic.",

But now, we can easily prepare the environment with Docker for our tests.

Are you wondering what the buzz about Angular.js, React.js, node.js, Ruby on Rails, Python mean in context of Java? Are you about to give up on JVM and learn completely new technologies? You don't have to. There is, in our opinion, a way to find synergy between the stability and maturity of Java and the best ideas in the emerging and popular technologies out there. Let us walk you through the history of Java/JavaScript relation, describe various attempts to bridge one to the other and finally show you OracleLabs GraalVM - polyglot JVM capable to execute Java, JavaScript, Ruby, R & other languages at full speed and full interop. Let us show you how easy it is to introduce the new languages and their ideas in an incremental fashion while building your existing Java enterprise workflow. Sun Microsystems motto used to be \"Innovation happens elsewhere\" - let us show you that JVM and Java ecosystem are still a place where great innovations can happen.",

With srcdeps, a Maven or Gradle project can define its dependencies in terms of specific source commits that are built by srcdeps \"on the fly\" when they are requested. Such source dependencies do not need to be present in any remote Maven repository - i.e. they do not need to be released. We will compare srcdeps with Maven SNAPSHOTs and show how they can be useful in testing and integration or for fixing third-party code. In a live demo, we will show how to switch a dependency from a released version to a source revision.",

This talk will unveil the contents stored by the HotSpot crash handler into the corresponding error files and how this information can be used to analyze and reproduce the crash. It will also introduce tools like the HotSpot Serviceability Agent which helps to introspect native core files and extract the relevant Java information from them which is otherwise not easily accessible by native debuggers. Detailed Plan: - run a Java application which crashes the VM - open the generated hs_err_pid file and explain its different sections: - native and Java stack trace - assembler instructions, register info and mapping to HotSpot data - threads, memory, events, exceptions, etc. - shared libraries, system information - different kind of crashes: - crashes in the runtime - crashes in native code - crashes in compiled (JITed) code - crashes in the GC - crashes during JIT compilation - use the Serviceability Agent to inspect Java/VM data structures in a core file: - what is the SA agent and how does it work - features of the SA agent - run a Java application which crashes during JIT compilation - inspect the generated replay_pid and inline_pid files - replay a crashing JIT compilation - problems when using -XX:ReplayCompiles feature - using the SA agent together with the -XX:ReplayCompiles feature Audience takeaway: The session will help you to better understand the root cause of VM crashes. This knowledge simplifies the task of fixing, working around or reporting the problem.
